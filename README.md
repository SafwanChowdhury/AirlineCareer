# Airline Career Application

This application allows users to browse airline routes data and manage pilots and flight schedules in a career mode.

## State Management Improvements

We've implemented several significant improvements to the state management and data fetching patterns in the application:

### 1. Consolidated Contexts

- **Pilot Context (`src/lib/contexts/pilot-context.tsx`)**:
  - Single source of truth for pilot-related state
  - Uses SWR for efficient data fetching with automatic caching
  - Includes loading and error states for better UX
  - Stores the selected pilot ID in localStorage for persistence

- **Schedule Context (`src/lib/contexts/schedule-context.tsx`)**:
  - Manages schedule-related state
  - Provides consistent interface for accessing schedule data
  - Includes loading and error states for better UX

### 2. Enhanced Custom Hooks

- **Pilot Hooks (`src/lib/hooks/use-pilot.ts`)**:
  - Consolidated all pilot-related hooks into a single file
  - Added comprehensive documentation
  - Standardized error handling and data fetching patterns
  - Provided utilities for data revalidation after mutations

- **Schedule Hooks (`src/lib/hooks/use-schedule.ts`)**:
  - Consolidated all schedule-related hooks
  - Added documentation and consistent interface patterns
  - Provided mutation functions with automatic cache invalidation

- **Fetch Utility (`src/lib/hooks/use-swr-fetch.ts`)**:
  - Enhanced with better error handling
  - Added retry logic for failed requests
  - Standardized response parsing and typing

### 3. Component Updates

- Updated all components to use the consolidated contexts and hooks
- Reduced direct API calls in favor of reusable hooks
- Improved loading and error state handling
- Enhanced UI feedback during data loading and mutations

### 4. Documentation

- Added detailed documentation for contexts (`src/lib/contexts/README.md`)
- Added detailed documentation for hooks (`src/lib/hooks/README.md`)

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns for data fetching and state management
- **Performance**: Better caching and revalidation strategies
- **Maintainability**: Clearer separation of concerns and less duplicated code
- **Developer Experience**: Better documentation and more predictable behavior
- **UX Improvements**: Consistent loading and error states throughout the app

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
